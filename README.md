assignment_polymorphism
=======================

Cheer time! When I say "Poly", you say "Morphic", "Gon", "Vore", "Glot" or whatever your receiver returns!

We will have two "parent" models: Managers and Employees.
As for our "child" model, we will have: Reviews.
Reviews can belong to either Managers or Employees.
