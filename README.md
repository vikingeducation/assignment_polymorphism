=======================

Cheer time! When I say "Poly", you say "Morphic", "Gon", "Vore", "Glot" or whatever your receiver returns!

## Votable Company BS and Tech BS

For this assignment, I chose to create a polymorphic association between votes and 2 different phrase types.  I also created a user model since typically humans vote for things.

b = Buzz.first
b.votes

s = Smart.first
s.votes
