I scream you scream we all scream for polymorphism!
=======================

This assignment uses polymorphic associations to model the vital relationship between individual ice cream scoops and the various containers they can occupy (cups? cones? maybe even sandwiches? With polymorphism, the sky's the limit!).

A Cup can CONTAIN multiple ice cream scoops

A Cone can CONTAIN multiple ice cream scoops

TODO (never to be done): a Cookie Pair can CONTAIN one ice cream scoop
