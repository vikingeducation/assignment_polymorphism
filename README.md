##Notes:

For this solution I will be building a polymorphic association between `Author`, `Song`, and `Book`. I figured that both `Songs` and `Authors` can both have `Authors` and would both potentially be models at a place like a media company or a publishing company. Who knows, maybe no one will ever use it but at least I'll still how to do this!
